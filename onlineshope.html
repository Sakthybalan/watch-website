            If you’ve been in the watch industry for any time at all, you’ve heard of the Seddiqi Group. 
            The family-run business has a reputation that precedes it around the globe, with admirers knowing them as “the watch people in Dubai.” It might be easy to imagine them as entitled Emirati elites, or rich real estate moguls who sought diversification through selling watches & jewelry, but just the opposite is actually true.The now-deceased, most senior Seddiqi began with a very modest station in life as part of a fisherman family – common to many people in the now bustling region. Dubai itself for many years was an extremely quiet fishing town which rose to prominence first through colonization and later through what most people agree is an extremely ambitious spending, civil engineering, and a comprehensive social plan. The region’s contemporary prominence and economic model is one which foreigners might regard as being very similar to Singapore. In fact, while Dubai and Singapore have many significant differences, there are also an enormous number of similarities including a shared passion for the sale and consumption of timepieces.

Possimus quidem consequuntur ad alias suscipit quis.One of the biggest misconceptions about Dubai is that the money comes from oil. Apparently, oil is no longer the major economic driver in Dubai, and this hub of the United Arab Emirates has become a thriving metropolis by making an intentional effort to be a gateway to the region for the rest of the world, with a focus on accessibility and speed. Being a planned financial hub of the region, thanks to a number of stability and security safeguards, is another thing which Dubai and Singapore have in common.If you’ve been in the watch industry for any time at all, you’ve heard of the Seddiqi Group.
